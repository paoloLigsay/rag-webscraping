Its poblacion (town proper) is designated as a National Historical Landmark. [5] The municipality is known as the Balisong and Barong Tagalog Capital of the Philippines. The town is home to hundreds of heritage structures dating from the Spanish colonial period. Scholars have been pushing for its inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Taal used to encompass a much more extensive area. In 1596, the former barrio of Bauan was established as a parish, effectively separating it from Taal. [11]\\n\\nFollowing the 1754 Taal Volcano eruption, the northern shoreline of Taal Lake that was previously part of Tanauan were annexed to Taal as Tanauan transferred from the lake's northwestern Tanauan Bay to Sala, its present-day barangay. It later became part of Talisay upon its establishment in 1869. [9]\\n\\nIn 1861, the southern parts of Taal were separated to form the new municipality of San Luis. [12] A year later, the northern and western parts of Taal were also separated to form the municipality of Lemery, which also consists the present-day Agoncillo.\\n\\nIn 1903, San Luis and Lemery were returned to Taal; San Luis's poblacion was reverted to its old name Balibago. [13] In 1904, the western Tanauan barrios of Balaquilong (Balakilong), Bayuyungan, Binirayan (Berinayan), Bugaan, and San Gabriel were annexed to Taal by virtue of Act No. 1244;[14] these barrios would eventually be returned to Talisay and become barangays of present-day Laurel. [15][16] Lemery and San Luis were once again separated from Taal and reconstituted as independent municipalities in 1906 and in 1918, respectively. [12][17]\\n\\nIn 1955, the northern barrios of San Nicolas, Gipit, Bangin, Pansipit, Calangay, Sinturisan, Talang, Abilo, Balete, Bancora, Saimsim, Maabud, Mulawin, Tambo, Calumala, Alasas, Calawit, and Pulangbato were separated from Taal to form the new municipality of San Nicolas. [18] In 1961, the eastern barrios of Sambat, Sinipian, Bihis, Calayaan, Irukan and Cutang Cawayan were separated from Taal to form the new municipality of Santa Teresita. [19]\\n\\nSince the Spanish period, the people of Taal lived by farming and commerce. The main produce are cotton, cacao and sugar which are made through the use of crude sugar mill called trapeche. Weaving and embroidery of barong and camisa (blouses) made from pi침a are popular home industries. Local embroidery businesses later expanded their products to include curtains, piano covers, pillowcases, tablecloth, table napkins and bed covers, adding more fame already earned by Taal embroidery.\\n\\nOther products produced in the town are balisong (butterfly knife) and various food treats such as the panocha (peanut brittle candy) and suman salehiya (a sweet suman), tapa (cured pork) and the local longganisa, all of which are available at the public market. Popular Taal dishes include adobo sa dilaw (yellow adobo) and sinaing na tulingan (bonita fish soup).\", metadata={'source': 'data/info.txt'})]"
